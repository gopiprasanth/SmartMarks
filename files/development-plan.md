## Development Guidelines

- **Testing Strategy:** Each commit should include appropriate tests
- **Versioning:** Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Documentation:** Update README and inline documentation with each commit
- **User Feedback:** Include mechanisms to gather usage data (with permission)
- **Privacy:** Ensure all data processing happens locally within the extension

This incremental approach ensures that at each step, you have a working extension with increasing capabilities, allowing for early feedback and course correction as needed.
