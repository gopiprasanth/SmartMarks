To help design or implement your Smart Bookmarks system effectively, could you clarify the following:

Do you want this system as a Chrome Extension, a local script (e.g. using Puppeteer), or something else?

Should the folder suggestions be based on URL content, page title, browsing history, or existing folder structure?

Would you like any ML/NLP techniques involved to auto-suggest folder names, or should it use simple keyword rules?

Should it integrate with Chromeâ€™s native bookmark system or manage bookmarks in a separate structure?

Let me know so I can guide you better on design and implementation steps.
